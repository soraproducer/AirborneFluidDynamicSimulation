    <h2 align="middle">Summary</h2>
      <p>We will implement a fluid dynamics simulation that estimates the behavior of an incompressible, homogeneous fluid under the Navier-Stokes equations. Specifically, we will simulate fluids generated when people breathing, sneezing or coughing in order to show the spread of virus. Moreover, we will make the user interface interactive. </p>
      
    <h2 align="middle">Problem Description</h2>
      <p>The coronavirus COVID-19 is affecting 209 countries and territories around the world and two international conveyances. People in N.Y. and S.F. are forced to take shelter in place. Until April 9th, 14,802 people lost their lives because of this virus in the U.S., and 88,538 people died around the world. However, there are still many people who choose to neglect the existence of this dangerous virus and refuse to use face masks to protect themselves and other people. Thus, we wish to create a 2D fluid dynamics simulator to simulate the situations of people breathing, coughing, and sneezing. We hope to use this project to activate their awareness about how severe this disease is. It will be difficult to mimic the real dynamics for the spreading particles in these situations because of the complexity of the simulation. Thus, we will first implement a 2D fluid dynamics simulator based on Navier-Stokes equations and other reference projects. Then, we will try to utilize the actual data from researches about human coughs and sneezes for a real simulation.</p>
      
    <h2 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h2>
      <p>Given the current world situation with Covid-19, our goal of this project is to simulate the spread of particles in the air. We will then simulate if wearing masks makes any difference in the process of social networking. Hopefully, we could finally apply different materials on masks and simulate the positive effects of wearing masks against virus spreading. </p>
      
      <p>The baseline of this project is to simulate the process of particle(virus) spreading. Through rendering fluid dynamics simulation, we will be able to see the virus' travelling path, velocity, and spreading time frame. In this part we will apply the Navier-Stokes equations and use GLSL fragment shaders to perform the physics calculations on the GPU. </p>
      
      <p>If we get ahead of our schedule, we hope to simulate the fluid particles with some kind of barriers (to simulate masks). We would like to show the huge differences of particles' travelling path under situations with and without masks. We want to achieve this since ultimately we want to remind people of ways of protecting themselves from the Covid-19 virus and other airborne diseases. </p>
      
      <p>We will measure our final result by both time and space complexity. We will also compare our fluids path with real-life airborne particle's travelling path to reveal the differences and consistencies. By the end of this project, we will be able to see the spreading paths of particles with different sizes in the air, we will also answer the ultimate question, that whether people should wear masks under airborn and direct contact diseases. </p>
